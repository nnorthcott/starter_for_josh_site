        <p class="about-text">My name is Josh Whitkin. I'm a professional with more than 7 years of
            industry experience in Games Design, Level Design, Scripting and Visual
            Effects. WHat makes me passionate about games is the combination of
            technology and creativity, and how multiple disciplines come togehter to
            create an interactive experience. Whether I'm designing for puzzle games, 2D
            platformers or 3D environments.
            I always tell a story.</p>
